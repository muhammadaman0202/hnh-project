                  VFX artists use software to create animations and special effects. They typically work on
                  movies, television shows, or video games. This position is usually offered full time, but
                  part-time positions are also available. When deadlines are tight, VFX artists may work late
                  nights or on weekends. Since they use computer software, VFX artists work in an office
                  environment, but they may also work at filming locations to help shoot scenes, and they may have
                  to travel frequently for the job. To ensure maximum visual quality, they work closely with
                  engineering and design teams. This career is well-suited to those who have a knack for visual
                  designs.
